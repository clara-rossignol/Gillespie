# Gillespie
Incomplete implementation of the Gillespie algorithm for systems of gene transcription and translation.

This is an implementation inspired from the following model
([Thattai M & van Oudenaarden A, Intrinsic noise in gene regulatory networks. PNAS (2001)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11438714/) ).

It is fully documented with Doxygen and contains unit tests (gtest) but not all methods are implented.
